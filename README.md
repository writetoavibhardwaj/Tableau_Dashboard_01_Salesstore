# Dashboard for Sales Tracking for Chain of Stores
This is a dashboard on Sales of a dummy store. This dataset is provided free by microsoft. It contains:
- Order details
- Return details
- Manager mapping table

Dashboard gives 3 views for leadership:

- Descriptive View
- Prescriptive View
- Annotations View

In the context of data analysis, there are three key types of views or approaches: descriptive, prescriptive, and annotations. Each serves a distinct purpose in understanding and leveraging data.

### Descriptive View
The descriptive view focuses on summarizing and interpreting historical data to understand what has happened in the past. It is primarily concerned with:
- **Data Aggregation**: Summarizing large datasets into manageable insights.
- **Visualization**: Using charts, graphs, and dashboards to present data.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Calculating measures such as mean, median, mode, standard deviation, etc.
- **Reporting**: Generating reports that provide a comprehensive overview of past performance and trends.

**Example**: A sales report showing total sales, average sales per month, and trends over the past year.

### Prescriptive View
The prescriptive view goes a step further than descriptive and predictive analytics. It not only predicts future outcomes but also suggests actions to achieve desired outcomes. It involves:
- **Optimization**: Identifying the best course of action among various options.
- **Decision Analysis**: Using algorithms and models to recommend decisions.
- **Scenario Analysis**: Evaluating different scenarios and their outcomes.
- **Advanced Analytics**: Employing techniques such as machine learning, simulation, and heuristics.

**Example**: A recommendation system that suggests optimal inventory levels to minimize costs and maximize availability based on historical sales data and future forecasts.

### Annotations
Annotations refer to additional information added to data points or visualizations to provide context or explain details. They are used to:
- **Clarify Data**: Adding notes or comments to explain anomalies or trends.
- **Highlight Important Information**: Drawing attention to key metrics or significant changes.
- **Provide Context**: Including relevant background information or linking to external sources.
- **Improve Communication**: Making data more accessible and understandable to stakeholders.

**Example**: Adding notes to a graph indicating the reasons for a sudden spike in sales, such as a successful marketing campaign or a seasonal effect.

### Summary
- **Descriptive View**: Focuses on understanding past data through summarization, visualization, and statistical analysis.
- **Prescriptive View**: Suggests actions and decisions based on predictive analytics and optimization techniques.
- **Annotations**: Provide additional context, explanations, and highlights within data visualizations or reports to improve clarity and communication.

These approaches can be used independently or in combination to derive meaningful insights and support data-driven decision-making.
